temporal-django |version|
===========================================

Temporal Django lets you track changes to objects over time and require that changes be documented with
metadata about when and why changes were made.

It was designed for auditable systems at Clover Health, where temporal history is used in workflow
systems that require documented history of changes that can be frequently accessed by day-to-day users
as well as auditors.
